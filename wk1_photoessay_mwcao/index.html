                <p class="caption-text">I battle with these things every day, and still have so far to go. I often wonder, will this feeling ever leave me? But this process of owning my own story and loving myself is one of the bravest things I can ever do. I think...try not to fake being OK, that only hurts me more. Be real with what you’re going through, just don’t let it consume you.</p>

                <p class="caption-text">I do “it” through love, through chosen family, working on (re)building parts of myself, learning how to love without conditions. I’ve managed to give myself what I deserve: true love towards myself. My children are my teachers, through their unconditional love and forgiveness they have shown me that human beings are taught to hate, they aren’t born with it. They have taught me redemption through love and that loving is the most radical thing anyone can do for themselves and others.</p>

                <p class="caption-text"> As I engage in anti-oppressive art, organizing and daily living, I heal myself by wash.ing. When confronted with experiences that trigger sadness, anger, and/or depression, I take a deep breath and wash. I press pause before the rumination begins and wash. myself by playing music, writing, running, biking, dancing and/ or anything else I ascribe to as wash.ing.

How do I do it?
